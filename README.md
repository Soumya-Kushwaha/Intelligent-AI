# Intelligent-AI

>The pace of progress in artificial intelligence (I’m not referring to narrow AI) is incredibly fast. Unless you have direct exposure to groups like Deepmind, you have no idea how fast—it is growing at a pace close to exponential. -- Elon Musk

<br>
Artificial Intelligence leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind. It is the backbone of innovation in modern computing, unlocking value for
individuals and businesses by helping to automate processes and providing insights into large datasets.

For instance, four stages of AI development are commonly recognized.

1) **Reactive machines**: Limited AI that only reacts to different kinds of stimuli based on preprogrammed rules. 
Does not use memory and thus cannot learn with new data. IBM’s Deep Blue that beat chess champion Garry 
Kasparov in 1997 was an example of a reactive machine.<br> 

2) **Limited memory**: Most modern AI is considered to be limited memory. It can use memory to improve over time 
by being trained with new data, typically through an artificial neural network or other training model. 
Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is considered limited memory artificial intelligence.<br>

3) **Theory of mind**: Theory of mind AI does not currently exist, but research is ongoing into its possibilities. 
It describes AI that can emulate the human mind and has decision-making capabilities equal to that of a 
human, including recognizing and remembering emotions and reacting in social situations as a human would. <br>

4) **Self aware**: A step above theory of mind AI, self-aware AI describes a mythical machine that is aware of its own existence and has the intellectual and emotional capabilities of a human. Like theory of mind AI, self-aware AI does not currently exist.<br>
